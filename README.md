 NYC Traffic Speed Analysis
Statistical Study Using Skewness & Kurtosis


**Summary**

This project presents a statistical analysis of New York City traffic speeds, focusing on understanding the distribution of traffic data by using skewness, kurtosis, and descriptive metrics.
The goal is to examine traffic behavior during different periods and draw meaningful conclusions from real-world data.

**Objectives**

Analyze the distribution of NYC traffic speed data.

Apply statistical measures (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis).

Identify distribution asymmetry and peak characteristics.

Interpret how traffic speed varies across time periods.

Provide meaningful insights based on statistical evidence.

**Dataset**

Data source: NYC traffic speed observations

Time period analyzed: August & November

Metrics studied: Speed (mph)

Categories: Peak hours vs Off-peak hours

The dataset is used to understand real traffic behavior and its statistical properties

**Statistical Methods Used**


**1. Descriptive Statistics**

Mean

Median

Mode

Range

Standard deviation

**2. Distribution Shape Analysis**

Skewness

Used to measure asymmetry

Karl Pearson’s Skewness Formula applied

Kurtosis

Used to understand peakedness

Kelly’s Kurtosis Formula applied

Percentiles (P10, P25, P75, P90) calculated

**3. Visual Analysis (if included in report)**

Histogram

Boxplot

Distribution curve

Numerical summary tables

**Key Findings**


Peak hours generally show more variability in speed.

Some months display left-skewed distributions, indicating heavier traffic congestion.

Kurtosis analysis reveals flatter (platykurtic) distributions during certain periods.

Off-peak hours tend to have more consistent, stable speed distributions.

These insights can help understand traffic flow and support better traffic management decisions.
